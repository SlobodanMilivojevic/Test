I was working this test in AngularJS.

1. Run index.html file in browser.
2. Typing some hero in the search field, maximum of 12 images of characters will appear.
3. Hovering over image, star icon will be visible and when it's clicked 
the character will be bookmarked locally.
4.Deleting letters in search field will remove current result list of Marvel characters 
and show Marvel characters that are bookmarked.
5. When the list of bookmarked Marvel characters is visible you can remove bookmarked 
Marvel character if you click on the star icon.


What I couldn't accomplish:

I couldn't connect bookmarked Marvel characters with those in the search result list. 
I couldn't indicate that they are already bookmarked.
It is possible to bookmark the same character more than once.
Sometimes it happens that images are not resized as it should be, but when window resize is 
triggered, image resize works as it should be (I think that there must be some delay in calling 
the function that resizes images). 
Until now, I didn't work Jest testing.
